## Purpose

I created this repo to **learn about infrastructures for modern web applications**. In other words, learn how to release code to production and still be able to sleep at night.

I use **Terraform** to build, change and version the infrastructure and  **AWS** to deploy it.

The code, services and infrastructure design is opinionated. Based on my learnings and past experience.
